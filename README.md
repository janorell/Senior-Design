### Project description
Our Project is on a Speech Therapy App. Our team is developing a game that will assist in the speech therapy of kids with autism spectrum disorder. We are developing this application for non-verbal children between the ages of 2 to 5. It is a dynamic speech therapy game for language cognition and speech training.

### About the Application
Our App is called the **SITA - Speech Interactive Therapy Application**. It is mainly designed to provide an early therapy action to the ASD kids in the absence of a therapist in a game-like environment.

### Design of SITA
- Developed in Unity 3D as proposed by the client.
- The User Interface is colorful and interactive in an appealing way to the kids. 
- Created with only 2D effects to avoid longer loading time and lagging when in kids mode to keep them engaged.
- Access control provided to parents and kids only for privacy reasons and everything is operated offline. 
- Database consists of a speech pathologist recorded model word videos organised based on phonemes and difficulty level. 
- Customization for kids based on their improvement in speech in terms of difficulty.

### Working of SITA
- Opens with the lock screen in which the parent answers a math question to ensure it is not the child logging in. 
- Goes to the levels/phonemes page where the difficulty level/phoneme type for the game can be chosen by the parent for their kids. 
- From the levels page control can be transferred to the settings page where the parent can track the progress of their child and perform additional settings. 
- After the level is chosen, the app will switch to the kids mode and a video of a speech pathologist pronouncing a word will be played to the child and the child will be asked to repeat it. 
- Once the child repeats the word, the kid will be rewarded with some visual 2D effects with an interactive screen where as the kid touches the screen the particle effects will pop up.

### Goals of SITA
- To provide speech therapy access to all ASD kids at minimum costs. 
- Make the speech training more fun filled in a gaming atmosphere.
- Ensure the training session is accessible to kids at their convenient times and places.
- Maintains privacy in terms of kids' voice, training and progress. 
- Helps keep a regular check on their improvement and customize the training sessions.
- Developed on Unity 3D which can be made both Android and iOS compatible.
